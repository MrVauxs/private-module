This is an template repo for private modules for content creators that aren't using the Foundry premium pack system.

This template uploads the released module to Google Drive using [google-drive-upload-git-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/google-drive-upload-git-action) GitHub Action.

A tutorial will be made if anyone asks @MrVauxs#8622 to make one.
